#summary How to use wuHMM to analyze CGH data.

The example R session below describes the process of loading NimbleGen data files, using wuHMM, and plotting the results.  The data files used in the examples below are available for download from [http://compbio.s3.amazonaws.com/demoData.zip here].  Download and decompress (unzip) the compressed demo data file in the same directory that you placed the wuHMM code files.  This data is also available at GEO under accession [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE5805 GSE5805].
 

Launch R.   The following R commands will get you started reading NimbleGen data, and detecting and plotting CNV predictions.  Lines begining with '>' are commands, '#' are comments.

{{{# read sample file containing sample and file names

> samples<-read.table("project.txt", sep="\t",quote='', header=TRUE, as.is=TRUE)
# iPos = 5
# iChr = 3
# iSignal = 14
# cols = 14
>system.time(loadSamples(samples,iPos=5,iSignal=14,iChr=3,ncols=14,autos=c(1:19),sex=c(TRUE,TRUE), prepend0=0))}}}
