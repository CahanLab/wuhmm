  * R 1.5 (or more recent):  If you don't already have R installed, go to CRAN where you can grab a copy.
  * The R _cluster_ package, obtainable from [http://cran.r-project.org/ CRAN].
  * The R _geneplotter_ package, available from [http://www.bioconductor.org/ BioConductor].
  * Python 2.4: This should be included with you Linux distribution.  If not, go to [http://python.org/ python.org] to get a copy.
  * _ghmm_:  This library is available from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghmm/ sourceforge] and installation instructions are available at [http://ghmm.sourceforge.net/installation.html ghmm.org].  This installation can be a bit complicated so I posted my installation notes [ here].  NOTE: You should replace model.c with a modified version which is available [ here].  This should be done *BEFORE* running the installation script.
