#summary Installation instructions

wuHMM prerequisites:

R 1.5 (or more recent):  If you don't already have R installed, go to CRAN where you can grab a copy.
The R _cluster_ and _geneplotter_ packages, obtainable from CRAN and BioConductor, respectively.
Python 2.4: This should be included with you Linux distribution.  If not, go to python.org to get a copy.
ghmm:  This library is available from sourceforge and installation instructions are available at ghmm.org.  This installation can be a bit complicated so I posted my installation notes here.  NOTE: You should replace model.c with a modified version which is available here.  This should be done *BEFORE* running the installation script.

Download the most recent wuHMM code from the _Source_ tab above.
